<h1>Three Concepts of Philosophy</h1>
<h2>Based on Armando F. Bonifacio</h2>

<div class="section">
<h2>1️⃣ Philosophy as Personal Worldview</h2>
<p>
Every person has a <span class="highlight">personal philosophy</span>, even if they cannot clearly define it.
This includes internalized values, beliefs, assumptions, and judgments about:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Right and wrong (Ethics)</li>
<li>Reality and existence (Metaphysics)</li>
<li>Truth and knowledge (Epistemology)</li>
</ul>
<p>
These presuppositions shape decisions, behavior, and conscience.
They are often unconscious but guide everyday life.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>2️⃣ Philosophy as Reflection and Analysis</h2>
<p>
Philosophy also means the activity of examining and analyzing our beliefs.
This involves questioning:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Why we believe what we believe</li>
<li>The foundation of our moral values</li>
<li>The basis of knowledge and truth</li>
</ul>
<p>
Professional philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and others engaged in systematic reflection.
This level goes beyond ordinary thinking and seeks clarity and logical structure.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>3️⃣ Philosophy as Reconstruction</h2>
<p>
Beyond analysis, philosophy aims to rebuild a more coherent and comprehensive worldview.
This reconstructed philosophy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Unifies knowledge across disciplines</li>
<li>Creates systematic frameworks</li>
<li>Seeks universal foundations</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is the highest level — not just criticizing beliefs, but constructing a better system of understanding.
</p>
