Topic 1 - Consumer Choice and Demand <br>
- preferences and utility <br>
<br>
Utility function <br>
- cardinal (number) <br>
- ordinal (order) <br>
<br>
Indifference Curves <br>
- negatively sloped <br>
- convex to the origin <br>
- never intersect <br>
<br>
Marginal rate of subsitution <br>
- MRSxy = ΔY/ΔX = -dY/dX = MUx/MUy <br>
<br>
Axioms of rational choice <br>
- completeness / comparability <br>
-- consumers can rank bundles <br>
--- A > B or A ≻ B <br>
--- A < B or B ≻ A <br>
--- A = B or A ~ B <br>
- transitivity of preference <br>
-- given bundles A, B and C <br>
--- if A ≻ B and B ≻ C, then A ≻ C <br>
--- if A ~ B and B ~ C, then A ~ C <br>
- convexity of preferences <br>
-- average is preferred over extremes <br>
- non-satiation <br>
-- more is preffered to less <br>
- continuity <br>
-- preferences carry to similar situations <br>
